# Predict Customer Churn

- Project **Predict Customer Churn** of ML DevOps Engineer Nanodegree Udacity

## Project Description

In this project, we will  identify credit card customers that are most likely to churn.
The Project will include a Python package for a machine learning project that follows coding (PEP8) and engineering best practices for implementing software (modular, documented, and tested). The package will also have the flexibility of being run interactively or from the command-line interface (CLI).

## Running Files
We will use #git and #conda:

1.Clone the repository

2.Create a conda environment

3.Activate the conda environment


Install the linter and auto-formatter:
pip install pylint
pip install autopep8

Run: python churn_library.py
python_script_logging_and_tests.py

check the pylint score using the below:
pylint churn_library.py
pylint churn_script_logging_and_tests.py

To assist with meeting pep 8 guidelines, use autopep8 via the command line commands below:
autopep8 --in-place --aggressive --aggressive churn_script_logging_and_tests.py
autopep8 --in-place --aggressive --aggressive churn_library.py
